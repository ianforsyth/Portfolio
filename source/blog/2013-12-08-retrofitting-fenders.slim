p Fenders are an essential part of winter and wet-weather riding. Not only are they a common courtesy on group rides (no one likes eating wheel spray all morning) but they function to keep your bike and back-side clean. That said, I have yet to find a set of fenders that fit my bike well, function properly, and can be put on or pulled off when needed. I don't want to be riding around with fenders on a sunny day, it just feels wrong. However, I think I've finally found a decent set despite needing some minor modifications.

p Now, my lack of fender use is not for lack of trying. I've probably been through three or four sets that I just wasn't fond of and ended up wasting money on. The first set I tried was the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.competitivecyclist.com/sks-raceblade-fender">SKS Raceblades</a> because they were supposed to be tight fitting and lightweight, exactly what I wanted for my race bike. But when I received them they were ill fitting and the fact they were so lightweight meant they were easily moved or blown out of place. Getting them high enough off the wheel to prevent rubbing was another issue. The next set I tried were the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Planet-Bike-Hybrid-Bicycle-Fender/dp/B000RYAL08/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1388280971&sr=8-7&keywords=bike+fenders">Planet Bike Full Fenders</a>. They were okay but I couldn&rsquo;t pull them off easily without having to readjust them. To add to my frustration, they were secured by rubber-bands and I snapped one of them. Not a bad set but I wasn&rsquo;t overall happy.

p For a while now, I've just been slapping on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SKS-X-Tra-Bicycle-Fender-wheels/dp/B000X61N2A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1388281183&sr=8-1&keywords=bike+fender">SKS X-Tra-Dry Rear Fender</a> when I need it and it does a good job of keeping my back and butt clean. The downside though is that it does nothing for my bike. The bottom bracket and seattube get covered in grime from the rear wheel and I have nothing on the front.

p Before I dive into my solution I'll throw a couple disclaimers at you. First, I gave up trying to find a good set of fenders that will fit my Cannondale CAAD10. I'm sure people out there have solutions (leave a comment if you do!) but I just couldn't settle on anything. So I decided to use my cx bike, a Jamis Nova Race, as a wet training bike. It has some bigger clearances. Second, You might not find this solution works for you. It's very tailor-made to fit my bike only. But the fender set I settled on was dynamic enough that I could play with it a bit, and that's it's biggest attribute in my opinion. Lastly, I tried this set before and threw them out! Why? Because they weren't a perfect fit. Why did I try them again? Because they're only $10 and I was feeling ambitious.


p So, with some leftover Christmas money, I bought some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KVOU4Y/ref=oh_details_o00_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Avenir Clip-On Fenders</a>. It looks like there are several similar designs out there but they&rsquo;re all around $15 and well worth it. It&rsquo;s a front and rear, comes with mounting hardware, and doesn&rsquo;t use anything to connect to the seatstays. But, it took some effort to get them mounted and sitting just right.

p.post-caption Some of the hardware up close (with my modifications).


p I'll start by pointing out that I'm not a handyman expert and the biggest problem was that the bolts provided, weren't proper lengths. There are enough bolts from my dad and grandpa in our basement to fill a swimming pool but I could not, for the life of me, manage to find a single other bolt with the correct diameter and thread spacing. The ones that came with the fenders did fit the bike though. They must be metric or slightly different than standard size because although I came close, I never found an exact match. So I had to get creative.


p First I installed the rear fender, it was relatively painless. The idea is you screw the mounting plate in the brake-bridge between the seatstays and then clip the end of the fender around the seattube. But for me, the hole in the break-bridge didn't go all the way through and it was really shallow. The long bolt just went part of the way in and didn't secure the plate. So, I cut the bolt down, about in half, and that was fixed. The rest of the install went fine, the rear was set.

p Then it was on to the front. The front fender just has the mounting plate and it's supposed to go behind the front brake. But, that wasn't going to work with this being a cyclocross bike. So one easy option I had was to bolt the plate on from behind the fork. I'd screw into the back of the front-brake piece on the other side (it was threaded there and the bolt did fit fine). However, the bolt wasn't long enough to go all the way through the thick fork to the threads.

p So I pulled off that front brake piece, secured by two bolts of its own, and figured maybe I could put it through the plate, pinning the plate between the piece and the fork. The mounting plate wasn't wide enough though so I had to file a bigger hole into it. That took a while but I got it around the front piece and secured in place. Last thing to do was bend the plate a little bit to get the fender angle right.

p.post-caption The fender sits a little higher off the front wheel than I would like but it still gets the job done.


p I've gone on a couple rides with them so far and they're working great. It's winter and between the snowfall and the snow melting, the roads are always wet. On the rare day they're not, the fenders can be pulled right off, just leaving the little inconspicuous mounting plates in place for re-installation. I may end up buying another set of these and trying to fit them to the road bike, they're workable enough that I might be able to get it right.

p Good luck with your own fender adventures.
